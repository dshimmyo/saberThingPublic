# saberThingPublic

First upload to github 06/02/2022 as a private repo for testing and will open up to the public soon.

I'm pretty busy lately but I want to provide some information about how to use this project.

If you want to see if it works you can fork or clone the repo, make sure you have git and git lfs installed.

After you've successfully cloned the repo you should be able to open the project in Unity 2019.4.28f1

Assuming you have SteamVR and a headset ready to go you should be able to open the main scene file which is in Assets/_Scenes/saberQuestLWRP

and you should be able to press play in the editor and start slicing things. Use the right controller grip button to "force grab" the saber to your hand and it will light up. Then swing away.

You can also BuildAndRun in the pc platform for better performance.

In order to deploy on an Oculus Quest 2, make sure you're using the default android sdk/ndk, if you've never changed it you don't have to do anything. Then switch platform to android. When it's done switching over you should be able to buildAndRun directly onto your device. Videos coming soon...

This project uses all custom VR mechanics, a modified MeshCut asset from years ago (from another author, Dustin Whirle), and if I'm not mistaken I'm using the Oculus Integration package

That's all for now, good luck!

I've just posted a video on getting started with this project from downloading to deploying to Windows and Oculus Quest 2. [https://youtu.be/Xz1WQihkBJg](https://youtu.be/Xz1WQihkBJg)
